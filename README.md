# Spotify-Inspired Music App

## Overview

This is a Spotify-inspired music application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for songs, view playlists, and control playback.
Users can also add songs to playlists, like songs, and view song lyrics. The design and functionality aim to mimic some of the key features of Spotify, providing a familiar and intuitive user experience.

### How It Works

- **Search Functionality**: Users can enter a song name into the search bar. The application then searches the internal database and displays the matching songs.
- **Playlists**: Clicking on a playlist (e.g., "Best of BTS") toggles the display of songs within that playlist. Songs in a playlist are displayed with their title and cover image.
- **Now Playing Screen**: When a song is played, the album art, song title, and artist information are displayed in the "Now Playing" section.
- **Playback Controls**: Users can control the playback using play, pause, next, and previous buttons. A progress bar allows users to seek through the current song.
- **Add to Playlist**: Clicking the heart icon adds the current song to a playlist.
- **Like Songs**: Clicking the like button marks the song as liked.
- **View Lyrics**: Clicking the "Show Lyrics" button displays the lyrics of the currently playing song in a modal or designated lyrics area.
